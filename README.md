# To-Do List App

A simple and responsive To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks — a great starting point for learning DOM manipulation and UI structuring.

## About This Project

This is my **first front-end project**, created while following a [YouTube tutorial by Easy Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0jO8kUrg-I&list=PLjwm_8O3suyOgDS_Z8AWbbq3zpCmR-WE9&index=2).  
The goal was to build a functioning To-Do List from scratch and practice the basics of web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
